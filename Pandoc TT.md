#Introduction#

What is pandoc? 

A useful tool for managing and controlling your documents in a marked down format. By learning specific codes and sequences you can control your computer and preserve documents using only your keyboard. 



a short blurb about what the tool does and why a person might want to use it
- reformat files using command-line operations. For example, the .epub file that won’t open with any of your computer programs can be reformatted by Pandoc into an .rtf file that can be opened by any text editing program.
- use templates to format your academic writing. Instead of formatting for MLA, APA, etc. as you write your papers, you can write in simple markdown format, focusing on content instead of format. Input the finished document into Pandoc and the outputted document will be formatted into the required citation style.
- writing in markdown allows you to 'future proof' your works because a .md file is the simplest, most easy-to-open format for text. This is important in light of phenomena such as planned obsolescence wherein you may suddenly find that Microsoft has changed the formatting requirements of Word and now all of your .docx files are unopenable. 

#Software & Setup
how to install the tool or other prerequisites for using it
- there are different versions for Mac, Windows and Linux downloadable here: <http://pandoc.org/installing.html>
- if you want to convert files into PDFs, the LaTeX extension is also required. For Mac users, you can download a simple version of the program here: <https://tug.org/mactex/morepackages.html>
- follow the installation instructions 
- once the program is installed, it won't appear in your applications. It functions within the command-line of your computer. To access the command-line of a Mac, open Finder and go to Applications/Utilities/Terminal (or hit cmd+space and type in 'terminal').
